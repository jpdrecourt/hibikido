- [ ] **Implementation**: New `batch_processor.py` module

## Phase 3: Refined Experimental Features (6-12 months)

### Temporal Ecology (Refined)

- [ ] **Manifestation Fatigue**: Frequently used sounds become temporarily less available
- [ ] **Seasonal Weighting**: Time-based relevance adjustments (birds at dawn, etc.)
- [ ] **Usage Aging**: Sounds gain "patina" from repeated use, affecting search weight
- [ ] **Temporal Clustering**: Sounds learn preferred manifestation contexts

- [ ] **Focus Detection**: Attention state affects manifestation complexity
- [ ] **Implementation**: Optional sensor integration via OSC input

### Collective Intelligence (Simplified)

- [ ] **Community Descriptions**: Crowdsourced semantic tags
- [ ] **Usage Pattern Sharing**: Learn from other users' successful invocations
- [ ] **Collaborative Filtering**: "Users who invoked X also invoked Y"
- [ ] **Emergent Vocabularies**: Discover new descriptive patterns
- [ ] **Implementation**: Optional cloud sync for usage patterns

## Phase 4: Advanced Experimental (12+ months)

### Quantum-Inspired Manifestation

- [ ] **Probabilistic States**: Multiple potential manifestations exist simultaneously
- [ ] **Observation Effects**: User attention influences manifestation probability
- [ ] **Entangled Sounds**: Semantically related audio influences each other
- [ ] **Uncertainty Principle**: Precise targeting reduces temporal control
- [ ] **Implementation**: Probabilistic orchestration engine

### Emergent Narrative

- [ ] **Story Arcs**: Consecutive invocations create narrative continuity
- [ ] **Character Development**: Sounds develop "personalities" over time
- [ ] **Plot Memory**: System remembers and continues evolving stories
- [ ] **Collaborative Storytelling**: Multiple users contribute to shared narratives
- [ ] **Implementation**: Narrative state machine integrated with search

### Synesthetic Expansion

- [ ] **Visual-Audio Mapping**: Color palettes influence search semantics
- [ ] **Texture Metaphors**: Tactile descriptors enhance audio vocabulary
- [ ] **Scent Associations**: Olfactory language expands description space
- [ ] **Taste Descriptors**: Culinary metaphors for audio characteristics
- [ ] **Implementation**: Multi-modal embedding space
